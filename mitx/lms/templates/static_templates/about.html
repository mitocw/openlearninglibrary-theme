                <p>The MIT Open Learning Library is home to selected educational content from <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT OpenCourseWare</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/school/mitx" target="_blank">MITx</a> courses, available to anyone in the world at any time. All material is free to use. Some resources, particularly those from MIT OpenCourseWare, are free to download, remix, and reuse for non-commercial purposes.</p>
                <p>MIT is committed to sharing learning materials with the world. The Open Learning Library provides additional opportunities to learn from MIT at your own pace, as on MIT OpenCourseWare, while engaging with problems and receiving instant feedback.</p>
                <p>You will be able to keep track of your own progress in the course. The Open Learning Library does not include discussion forums, certificates, or the ability to transfer your progress to <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX.org</a>. For those hoping to participate in a discussion or seeking a credential for completing a course, we will do our best to highlight when a credential-bearing offering is available on <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX.org</a>.</p>
                <p>You’ve discovered us during our prototype phase. We hope you’ll come along for this journey.  Over time, we will add new courses, develop site features, and enhance the user experience.  We welcome your feedback on the site, including your thoughts on areas for improvement.  Please email <a class="link-email" href="mailto:&#109;&#105;&#116;&#111;&#108;&#108;&#045;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#109;&#105;&#116;&#046;&#101;&#100;&#117;">&#109;&#105;&#116;&#111;&#108;&#108;&#045;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#109;&#105;&#116;&#046;&#101;&#100;&#117;</a> with your feedback or any requests for support.</p>

                                <p>You can think of the three different resources as a spectrum of offerings utilizing MIT content for different types of learning experiences. On one end is edX.org — MITx courses on edX are end-to-end course experiences with certificates available for you to earn, live teaching support in a discussion forum, and start and end dates. On the other end is MIT OCW, which is a completely self-guided experience containing published content from MIT courses that is open all of the time and licensed for reuse, but that does not include any interactive content. Open Learning Library sits in between. As in many MITx courses, Open Learning Library provides interactive course experiences that include auto-graded assessments that give you instant feedback and allow you to track your progress as you work your way through learning the subject matter. Like OCW, this content is always open and self-guided and includes no live support, discussion forum, or certificates.</p>

                    I cannot overstate the impact that MIT Open Learning has had on my education. I have been a student of MOOCs for several years now, and the courses offered by MIT Open Learning have been some of the most impactful and useful that I have taken. I have been able to take courses on a wide variety of topics, and the quality of the content and the instructors has been consistently excellent. I have also been able to use the courses I have taken to further my career, as many of the topics covered are directly relevant to the work I do. I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to take advantage of MIT Open Learning, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a high-quality, affordable education.
